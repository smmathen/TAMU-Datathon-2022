# TAMU Datathon 2022
## Shawn Mathen
Howdy! I came into this event as a beginner in data science and just wanted to learn more about what it is and how I can use it. While I unfortunately was unable to create a groundbreaking ML algorithm, I learned some pretty cool stuff, mainly about virtual environments and Streamlit. I found some data online about NFL Rushing Statistics, and wanted to use the tools I learned about to create a more appealing way to view this data, since the website I found it on is pretty old-school.

My app is hosted through [Streamlit](https://smmathen-tamu-datathon-2022-app-xwsbac.streamlitapp.com/)! If the link doesn't work, you can also copy/paste https://smmathen-tamu-datathon-2022-app-xwsbac.streamlitapp.com/ into your browser.

My inspiration came from my love of football and some YouTube videos I found online, so I just wanted to play around with some of this data.
